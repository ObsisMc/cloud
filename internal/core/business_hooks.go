// The B side of the Agent Run control plane seam: Cloud's IssueRun, Thread, delivery and release
// lifecycle, bound onto the five callbacks an upstream A side leaves nil.
//
// Ownership (controller-integration D6, invariant 7). The control plane owns every table that
// records execution evidence — `execution_work`, `node_executions`, `node_event_receipts`,
// `thread_commands`, `space_agents`, `revisions` and `workspaces.issue_run_id` — and this package's
// B side owns the business tables (`issue_runs.phase` and its Thread columns, `thread_entries`).
// One writer per table: the A side never writes a business fact, and nothing here writes execution
// evidence, so there is exactly one dispatcher and one state machine.
//
// Transaction. Each hook is invoked from inside the control-plane transaction that just persisted
// the evidence it reacts to, so the transition it decides commits or rolls back with that evidence.
// The seam passes the caller's `*sql.Tx`; businessTransaction recovers the enclosing `*transaction`
// so the B side runs on that same transaction rather than on a second view of the handle whose
// enqueues, Thread entries and post-commit hints would be dropped. Nothing here opens a transaction,
// spawns a goroutine, or defers a post-commit effect, and no hook performs external I/O.
//
// Failure. A non-nil error is turned by the seam into `409 business_hook_failed`, which rolls the
// control-plane transaction back: the Node's event is not acknowledged and is replayed. That is why
// the hooks never "tolerate" a contradiction — a business transition that cannot be justified by
// authoritative rows must abort rather than be skipped silently.

// businessTransactionKey names the context slot a transaction publishes itself under for the
// duration of its own body. It is an unexported struct so no other package can collide with it.

//
// The seam hands a hook the caller's `*sql.Tx` and nothing else. That handle is the same one the
// enclosing `*transaction` wraps (transact publishes it on the context before running its body), so
// recovering it here is what keeps the B side's writes, enqueues and hints in one commit with the
// control plane's. A hook reached with a handle that does not belong to the transaction that
// published itself is an invariant violation — running on a foreign handle would silently split the
// settlement across two commits — so it aborts as a database failure.
