// The delivery half of an Agent IssueRun: the B-owned settlement behind the control plane's
// OnDeliverySettled hook (controller-integration D6 deliverySettled, IssueRun D3/D4/D5; plan §5
// Batch 2).
//
// The control plane owns the whole takeover this reacts to. It acknowledges the delivery execution's
// terminal Node event with a receipt, writes the durable result, runs the object-store check that the
// repository forbids holding a transaction across, records its verdict in `revision_verifications`,
// registers the `revisions` row, and only then calls this hook — all in one transaction, so a
// settlement that fails rolls the Revision and the receipt back with it and the Node replays. What
// arrives here is therefore a *verdict*, not a Node claim: `saved` and `unchanged` carry the id of a
// Revision this transaction has already committed, `failed` carries either a reason from the wire's
// closed set or Cloud's own `verification_failed`, and `skipped` says the deployment has no object
// store and no delivery will ever happen for this run.
//
// Nothing here writes execution evidence. The two things this file owns are the run's own business
// conclusion (D4's `releasing` with its deliveryState) and, when a failure has not yet exhausted
// D5's limits, the release of the next delivery attempt through the control plane's enqueue.

// Delivery outcome spellings, shared by the control plane's settled object and the run's stored
// `result.deliveryState`: one vocabulary for one fact, so the hook contract and the durable run
// result cannot drift apart.

// executions already registered for the run, so the first retry (one failure) waits 30 seconds.

// settleDelivery is the B-owned delivery-settlement core behind the A→B hook OnDeliverySettled
// (controller-integration D6 deliverySettled, IssueRun D3/D4/D5; plan §5 Batch 2).
//
// It runs on the caller-owned *transaction of the delivery execution's terminal event, inside which
// everything it decides must commit or roll back with the receipt, the verification verdict, the
// Revision and the durable result. It never opens its own transaction, spawns a goroutine, or defers
// a post-commit effect.
//
// Contract (the rows are checked in this order, and the first one matches first):
//
//	phase != 'delivering'     → deterministic no-op: a replay or a late result decides nothing,
//	                            whether it reports a failure or a success.
//	saved / unchanged         → releasing with deliveryState=saved|unchanged and the registered
//	                            Revision id (releaseAfterDelivery). The id is part of the contract,
//	                            not an extra: the control plane writes the Revision before this hook
//	                            may see a success, so a success without one is an internal
//	                            contradiction rather than a run Cloud should release as saved.
//	failed, given up         → releasing with deliveryState=failed (releaseAfterDelivery).
//	failed, not given up     → the run STAYS `delivering` and a new delivery work item is released
//	                            with D5's backoff (a retry never creates a new logical delivery —
//	                            the run, its Revision target and its Workspace are unchanged).
//	skipped                  → releasing with deliveryState=skipped: the deployment has no object
//	                            store, so no attempt could ever succeed and retrying would hold the
//	                            Workspace against a limit that can never be reached.
//
// Identity is re-read, never taken from the caller: the run must be the one the registered delivery
// execution was dispatched for, through execution → execution_work → run, and the work item must be
// this run's `deliver_revision` work. A mismatch is an error that rolls the takeover back rather than
// a settlement projected onto some other run.
