// Phase 5 Batch 2 white-box acceptance for the release half of an Agent IssueRun: the `releasing →
// done` transition behind the RunWorkspaceDeleted hook (IssueRun D3/D4, controller-integration D6;
// plan §5 Batch 2). Everything here is real PostgreSQL in an isolated schema; the hook is driven
// inside a caller-owned transaction exactly as the delete_workspace terminal transaction drives it.
//
// Why these live in the core package rather than only in integration: the obligation under test is a
// transaction-scoped hook contract — which phase it accepts, what it refuses, and that a replay
// changes nothing — and the release half must be provable without standing up a Node, a Controller
// and a whole delete operation. The end-to-end chain (a real delete_workspace operation reaching
// `succeeded` and settling the run) is integration's job.
