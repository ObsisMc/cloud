// The B-owned release half of an Agent IssueRun: `delivering → releasing` with D4's final status,
// and `releasing → done` once the run Workspace's delete has been taken over — or once D8's single
// give-up condition says it never will be (IssueRun D3/D4/D5/D8, controller-integration D6
// deliverRevision/RunWorkspaceDeleted; plan §5 Batch 2).
//
// Two transitions, one shape: each is a CAS on the phase the caller re-read, and each declares or
// completes the run Workspace's delete in the same transaction that commits the phase write, so the
// run can never be `releasing` without a durable delete intent, nor `done` without a settled delete
// operation. Neither transition writes anything else about the run: `releasing` sets `status` exactly
// once from the session end reason (D4), and `done` deliberately changes no business outcome —
// "终态不变" in D3's own words, which is why `done` carries no separate status of its own and why
// `done` is never a synonym for `completed` (mandate §15).
//
// `done` therefore has two entry conditions (D3's table, as amended by D8), and they are not the same
// statement: a `succeeded` delete means the Workspace is gone, while D8's expiry means Cloud stopped
// waiting and the Workspace is still there. Only the first may ever be reported to a user as a
// released Workspace.

// runSessionExecution resolves the run's settled agent_session execution: the execution whose durable
// result carries the session end reason D4 derives the final status from, and the one the delivery
// spec names as `session_execution_id`. There is at most one per run — one `agent_session` work item
// gives at most one execution (D-021) — and `result IS NOT NULL` is what makes it "settled" rather
// than in flight. nil means the run never had a session terminal fact, which no caller of this file
// can legitimately be looking at.

//
// It is the only writer of `releasing` on the delivery path, and it is reached from exactly three
// approved places in DeliverySettled: a verified delivery (`saved`/`unchanged`, with the Revision id
// the control plane committed just before the hook ran), D5's give-up on a delivery that kept failing
// (`failed`, with no Revision), and a delivery whose declared objects Cloud could not confirm, which
// settles as `failed` under the same D5 rules. The `status` it writes is derived from the session's
// own end reason, so the business outcome ("how did the Agent run end") stays independent of the
// delivery outcome ("was the Revision saved"), which IssueRun invariant 4 requires: a `completed` run
// may legitimately carry `deliveryState=failed`.
//
// What is deliberately NOT here: the Agent-authored reply comment D4 asks for on `completed`. D4 says
// Cloud writes "Thread 中 Agent 的最后一条消息" as a reply comment, but that text lives inside a
// `SessionUpdate` record — a business payload owned by desktop `ora-history` — and Thread D2 forbids
// Cloud from parsing business fields ("Cloud 不解析业务字段") while Thread invariant 6 forbids
// rewriting Node record content. There is no approved field path to read the message text from, so
// writing a comment would mean guessing a foreign schema. The conflict is registered as a gap in the

//     lie D8 forbids. The row is the record of a residual resource, and it must stay readable.

//     inventing a new `action` string for it would publish an event no approved decision defines. The
//     reason is on the run itself, as `failure_reason`, where a client already reads it.
