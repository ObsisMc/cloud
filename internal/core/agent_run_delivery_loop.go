// The three background recovery passes of the delivery/release half (IssueRun D3/D5/D8, operation D4;
// plan §5 Batch 2). All follow the repository's established bounded-pass shape — a read-only scan
// outside the advisory lock, then one short transaction per run, with the sleep between ticks owned
// by the caller — exactly like the dispatch, session-start, idle-Thread and cancel passes. None of the
// three makes a business decision the durable state has not already made:
//
//	GiveUpStaleDeliveriesOnce      applies D5's two give-up limits to a run the delivery path has
//	                               already left `delivering`; it decides nothing that a fresh
//	                               delivery result would not decide, it only decides it on the clock.
//	RedeclareRunWorkspaceDeletesOnce  re-declares a delete intent that the `releasing` transition
//	                               already committed. The run being `releasing` IS the decision; this
//	                               pass only guarantees the Controller has an operation to execute.
//	GiveUpStaleWorkspaceReleasesOnce  applies D8's single give-up limit to a run the release path has
//	                               already left `releasing`, so a Workspace whose Node never answers
//	                               again cannot hold the run (and its Project's operation slot)
//	                               forever. The run ceases to be retried; it is never reported as
//	                               deleted.
//
// None of them invents a limit. D5 fixes the give-up window and the unreachability window as Cloud
// configuration ("这两个上限是第一版默认值（Cloud 配置项）"), D8 reuses the unreachability one verbatim
// ("本决策不为删除侧引入新的时限") and the delete re-declaration has no limit at all: a `releasing` run
// must reach `done`, and D3's own durability rule ("Controller 丢信号时靠周期领取兜底") is precisely
// that Cloud keeps a durable intent reachable until it is executed — or, under D8, until Cloud
// concludes it will not be.

// agentDeliveryBatchSize bounds one scan pass so a single tick advances at most this many runs.
// Ordering is deterministic (the oldest first) so every tick drains the backlog without starving.

// giveUpStaleDelivery releases one `delivering` run whose delivery has exceeded D5's limits, in its

// rather than an error.
//
// The whole decision is `deliveryGivenUp`, and it is taken inside the transaction that writes the

// succeeded, which is exactly the "don't pre-empt a delivery that is still alive" obligation.
