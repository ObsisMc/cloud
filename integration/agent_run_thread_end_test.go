// Phase 4C S7 acceptance for the public Thread end (Thread D4, approved by G-018; plan
// §4C.10/§4C.15/§4C.16).
//
// The endpoint is the third of D4's three ending triggers and the only client-facing one. What it
// has to hold is narrower than the other two, and the tests below are shaped by that:
//
//   - It ends, it does not settle. The response is `202 {"threadState": "ending"}` and the run's own
//     phase/status are untouched: `ended`, `discarded`, Revision settlement and the Workspace delete
//     are Phase 5 and stay out of this path (G-019).
//   - It is exactly one transition. One `EndSession{reason: user_ended}` command, one commit, and no
//     new Thread entry: ending is not something the conversation said, so it allocates no `seq`.
//   - It is idempotent under the caller's key, through the same generic mechanism every other public
//     POST uses — the precheck runs before the lifecycle is even read, so a replay is answered from
//     the recorded response rather than by re-deciding.
//
// Every case goes through real HTTP and real PostgreSQL, because those are the obligations: the
// idempotency record, the command and the state change have to be one commit, and the races below are
// races between real transactions sharing the real advisory lock.
