// Phase 5 Batch 1 acceptance: the authoritative takeover of a session execution's terminal Node
// event, and the three transitions that commit with it (Thread D4's last row, Thread D3's
// `discarded`, IssueRun D3's `delivering`).
//
// The chain under test is the production one, end to end. The terminal event arrives over the real
// gRPC control surface (`ExecutionService.TakeOverNodeEvent` → the `agent_session_takeover` action),
// because that — not the Thread batch RPC — is where approved controller-integration D2 routes an
// execution's terminal fact. The scene is driven through the same production steps Phase 4B/4C use:
// the session declaration, the Controller claim/registration, the public Thread POST and the Thread
// event takeover that delivers a turn. The subscriber side is the real SSE endpoint.
//
// What is asserted, and why it is one assertion rather than several: receipt, durable result, Thread
// `ended`, the queued turns' `discarded`, the run's `delivering` transition, the released delivery
// work item and the sequence advance all live in ONE transaction (§7). Each case therefore asserts
// the whole group — a commit that produced only part of it is the failure mode these tests exist to
// catch, and a per-field test would pass on a partial commit.
//
// What the tests are careful *not* to claim: nothing here asserts anything about DeliverySettled,
// the Revision row, `releasing`, `done` or multi-instance delivery. Those are Phase 5 Batch 2 and
// stay unimplemented (G-019 is only partially closed by this batch).
