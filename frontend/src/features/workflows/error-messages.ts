 * Maps the workflow API's fault codes onto the messages the interface shows.

 * this table is the only place that decides what a member reads. A code with no
 * entry falls back to a generic message rather than rendering the raw code:
 * an unlisted fault is a gap in this table, not something to show a member.
 *
 * `version_conflict` and `version_required` are separate entries because they
 * ask for different actions — reload and retry versus a bug in the caller —
 * even though both end in the same advice today.
