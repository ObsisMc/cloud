 * Client for the MSW-mocked domain (`/mock-api/*`), kept separate from the
 * orval-generated client in `src/api` which talks to the real Go backend.
 *
 * Pages without a backend counterpart yet (issues, agents, chat, ...) run on
 * this client. Their routes carry the real space slug, which the demo store
 * does not know, so the slug is rewritten to the seeded workspace before the
 * request reaches MSW: every real space shows the same demo data until the
 * page gets a real API. The mock domain has no authentication; the real
 * session lives in the gateway cookie and never reaches these handlers.
