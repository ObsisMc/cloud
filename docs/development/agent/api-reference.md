# API Reference — for agents

Every route in the allowlist (`router.Routes()`). All public routes are tenant-scoped and require
service-JWT (gateway) + user-JWT + active membership. Error codes: see
[architecture.md](architecture.md) §Errors. Conventions (idempotency, version, pagination): see
[architecture.md](architecture.md) §Core conventions.

Legend: 🔑 = `Idempotency-Key` required · 🔢 = `version` precondition (428/409).

## Identity & tenancy

| Method | Path | Body fields | Response |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/v1/me` | — | User |
| GET | `/api/v1/me/tenants` | — | `{items, nextCursor}` |
| GET | `/tenants/{tid}/members` | — | `{items, nextCursor}` |
| PUT | `/tenants/{tid}/members/{uid}` | `role`, `status`, 🔢`version` | membership (admin only) |

## Workspace members (`/spaces/{sid}/members`)

`SpaceMember`: `id, workspaceId, userId, role, status, version, displayName, joinedAt`.
`role ∈ owner|admin|member` (schema-level); `status ∈ active|disabled`.

| Method | Path | Body fields | Response |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/spaces/{sid}/members` | — | `{items:[SpaceMember], nextCursor}` (workspace members) |
| POST 🔑 | `/spaces/{sid}/members` | `email`* | SpaceMember (admin or owner; fixed `member` role; unknown email → 404 `user_not_registered`; idempotent re-add) |
| PUT | `/spaces/{sid}/members/{uid}` | `role`, `status`, 🔢`version` | SpaceMember (**owner-only**) |
| DELETE 🔑 | `/spaces/{sid}/members/{uid}` | 🔢`version` | SpaceMember (**owner-only**; hard delete) |

### Access model (Workspace member management, Step 3A)

- **Change role — owner-only** (`PUT`): the actor must be the workspace **owner** (admin/member → 403
  `space_role_required`). Only `admin↔member` transitions are allowed: the **owner role is immutable**
  through this API — any write targeting an owner row, or any transition *to* owner (member→owner,
  admin→owner, owner self-demote) → **409 `ownership_transfer_not_supported`**. Ownership transfer is a
  separate, not-yet-designed feature; the last-owner invariant is guaranteed by owner-immutability (a
  workspace always has exactly one owner).
- **Remove member — owner-only** (`DELETE`): the actor must be the workspace **owner**; removing the
  owner (including self-removal) → **409 `cannot_remove_workspace_owner`**. Removal is a **hard delete of
  the workspace membership row only** — the user account, their tenant membership, and any resources they
  created (e.g. `projects.owner_user_id` keeps recording the creator) are untouched and remain in the
  workspace. The removed member's workspace access is revoked naturally: `listSpaces`/`spaceMember`/
  `workspaceRole` are all backed by the active membership row, so after removal the workspace, its
  projects, and their runtime workspaces become invisible (404) — with no creator backdoor, since
  space-scoped resource access first requires active workspace membership.
- **Add member — admin or owner** (`POST`): unchanged from the enrollment step; unknown email → 404
  `user_not_registered`; re-adding an existing member is idempotent (returns the existing row without
  mutating role/status/version). A disabled membership can be toggled back via `PUT` (`status`).
- Both `PUT` and `DELETE` need the current `version` (428/409 on conflict); `POST`/`DELETE` need an
  `Idempotency-Key`.

## Issues (board)

`Issue`: `id, tenantId, creatorUserId, assigneeType, assigneeId?, assigneeUserId?, parentIssueId?,
projectRef?, title, description, status, priority, position, number, properties, labels[], version,
createdAt, updatedAt, deletedAt?`. Non-`user` `assigneeType`/`assigneeId` and `projectRef` are opaque
refs — shape-validated, not resolved this wave.

| Method | Path | Body fields | Response |

| GET | `/issues` | query `?q=` | `{items, nextCursor}` |
| POST 🔑 | `/issues` | `title`*, `description`, `status`, `priority`, `assigneeUserId`, `assigneeType`, `assigneeId`, `parentIssueId`, `projectRef`, `properties` | `{resource: Issue}` |
| GET | `/issues/{iid}` | — | Issue |
| PUT | `/issues/{iid}` | any create field + 🔢`version` | Issue |
| DELETE 🔑 | `/issues/{iid}` | 🔢`version` | Issue (soft-deleted) |
| POST 🔑 | `/issues/{iid}/move` | `status`, `beforeId`, `afterId`, 🔢`version` | Issue |

| GET | `/issue-groups` | query `?by=status\|priority\|assigneeUserId`, `?q=` | `{groups:[{key,items}]}` |

## Issue extensions (wave 2)

| Method | Path | Body fields | Response |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/issue-statuses` | — | `{items:[IssueStatus]}` (auto-seeds 7) |
| POST 🔑 | `/issue-statuses` | `key`*, `name`*, `description`, `category`, `color`, `icon` | `{resource: IssueStatus}` |
| PUT | `/issue-statuses/{sid}` | `name`, `description`, `category`, `color`, `icon`, `position`, 🔢`version` | IssueStatus |
| DELETE 🔑 | `/issue-statuses/{sid}` | 🔢`version` | IssueStatus (409 if system) |
| GET | `/labels` | — | `{items:[Label]}` |
| POST 🔑 | `/labels` | `name`*, `color` | `{resource: Label}` (409 dup) |
| PUT | `/labels/{lid}` | `name`, `color`, 🔢`version` | Label |

| POST 🔑 | `/issues/{iid}/subscribers` | `userId`* | `{resource: User}` |
| DELETE 🔑 | `/issues/{iid}/subscribers` | `userId`* | `{resource: User}` |

## Issue collaboration (Wave 3A)

`IssueRun`: `id, tenantId, issueId, version, executorType, executorId, status, externalExecutionId?,
executionContextRef?, workflowInvocationRef?, triggerEvidenceKind, triggerEvidenceRefId?, parentRunId?,
retryOfRunId?, rerunOfRunId?, delegatedFromRunId?, attempt, maxAttempts, input, result?, error?,
failureReason?, triggerSummary, queuedAt, dispatchedAt?, startedAt?, completedAt?, fireAt?,
leaseExpiresAt?, createdAt, updatedAt, deletedAt?`. `executorType ∈ agent|team|workflow` (opaque ref,
unresolved); `status` is an SQL-WHERE-guarded 7-state machine
(`queued/dispatched/running/completed/failed/cancelled/deferred`).

`ContextRef`: `id, tenantId, issueId, refType, refId, createdAt`.

Wave 3A also extended `Comment` with `authorType`/`authorId`/`parentId`/`seq` (uniform author ActorRef,
threading, shared per-issue timeline `seq`).

**Still schema-ready / not API-implemented** (the DB accepts, the HTTP surface does not):

| Capability | State |
| --- | --- |
| `issue_comments.author_type = system` | CHECK allows `system`, but **no** code path writes a `system` comment yet (agent/team replies now go through the internal run-reply path, §Interaction). |
| `ConversationTarget` | **Not implemented** — out of scope this wave, left open in §37.17. |

**Implemented by Wave 3B-1** (migration `0009` — formerly `0008`, renumbered in the workspace integration; semantics frozen in
[12-collaboration-architecture.md §37](../../migrations/multica-issue-board/12-collaboration-architecture.md#37-wave-3b-0--collaboration-interaction-model-frozen)):

- `Comment.authorType` is no longer hard-coded `user`: mock agent/team runs post a reply comment with
  `author_type='agent'`/`'team'` through an **internal** path (no public impersonation — clients cannot
  set `authorType`).
- `issue_activities` is now readable: `GET /issues/{iid}/timeline` returns Comment + Activity merged in
  one shared per-issue `seq` order.
- `Comment.targets[]` is implemented on comment create (see the Interaction section below).
- `GET /collaboration/targets` exposes the `@`-picker projection (*not* an Agent/Team/Workflow API).

The 14 integration ports are inventoried in that doc's §6.4.

| Method | Path | Body fields | Response |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/issues/{iid}/runs` | — | `{items:[IssueRun]}` |
| POST 🔑 | `/issues/{iid}/runs` | `executorType`*, `executorId`*, `input`(object) | `{resource: IssueRun}` (`status=queued`; pending-executor dup → 409 `pending_run_exists`) |
| GET | `/issues/{iid}/runs/{rid}` | — | IssueRun |
| GET | `/issues/{iid}/context-refs` | — | `{items:[ContextRef]}` |
| POST 🔑 | `/issues/{iid}/context-refs` | `refType`*, `refId`* | `{resource: ContextRef}` |
| DELETE 🔑 | `/issues/{iid}/context-refs/{crid}` | — | ContextRef (hard delete) |

There is **no** `DELETE /issues/{iid}/runs/{rid}` — terminal runs are history, not deletable.

## Issue collaboration interactions (Wave 3B-1)

The `@` collaboration spine. `POST /comments` now accepts an optional `targets[]` array of
`{type, id, task?}`; each target becomes one persisted `Interaction` row and, for `agent`/`team`,
drives a mock `IssueRun` via the ExecutionDispatcher port. `user` = **Mention Mode** (no run);
`agent`/`team` = **Task Mode** (`task` required → 400 `task_required`); `workflow` = **Form Mode**
(rejected with 409 `workflow_not_available` this wave). Clients **cannot** set `authorType`.

| Method | Path | Body fields | Response |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/collaboration/targets` | query `?q=` | `{items:[CollaborationTargetSummary]}` (`{type,id,displayName,description,interactionDescriptor}`) |
| GET | `/issues/{iid}/timeline` | — | `{items:[TimelineEntry]}` (Comment + Activity merged by shared `seq`) |
| GET | `/issues/{iid}/interactions` | — | `{items:[Interaction]}` (`{id,commentId,targetType,targetId,mode,task,runId,input,createdAt}`) |
| POST 🔑 | `/issues/{iid}/comments` | `body`*, `parentId`?, `targets[]`? (`{type,id,task?}[]`) | `{resource: Comment}` (creates interactions + mock runs as a side effect) |

Consumers today: `/collaboration/targets` feeds the frontend `@` picker; `/timeline` feeds the
frontend Activity panel; `/interactions` has **no UI consumer yet** — its current callers are the
integration tests (they assert the comment→interaction→run cardinality) plus debugging. It is kept
because it is the read surface for the spine table; the frontend hook `useInteractions` exists but is
unused. Widening it later must stay additive.

### Workflow interaction (Wave 3B-2, migration `0010` — formerly `0009`, renumbered in the workspace integration)

Form Mode. `POST /comments` with `targets:[{type:"workflow", id}]` now records a `mode='form'`,
`runId=null` interaction and **creates no run**; only an explicit confirm does. `409
workflow_not_available` (3B-1) is **SUPERSEDED**.

| Method | Path | Body fields | Response |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/collaboration/forms/{formRef}` | query `?issueId=` | `FormDescriptor` (`{formRef,title?,description?,fields[]}`) |
| POST 🔑 | `/issues/{iid}/collaboration/assist` | `targetId`*, `values`(object) | `{suggestedValues, suggestedContextRefs, explanations?}` — **stateless, suggest only, no side effects** |
| POST 🔑 | `/issues/{iid}/interactions/{ixid}/confirm` | `values`(object)*, `contextRefs`(array of `{refType,refId}`) | `{resource: IssueRun}` (the initial run, `status=queued`; dispatch is post-commit) |

- `formRef` is an **opaque** provider token (not a UUID) and appears in a path segment.
- `?issueId=` is **optional** and additive. Omitted (or empty) ⇒ the descriptor is exactly the one this
  route served before the platform fields existed. Present ⇒ the descriptor is tailored to that issue
  and the platform fields are **prepended**, in this order:

  | key | label | type | required | default | injected when |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  | `repository` | 仓库地址 | `text` | ✅ | issue's `project_ref → projects.repository_url` | always |
  | `branch` | 分支 | `text` | ✅ | the same project's `default_branch` | always |
  | `version` | 运行版本 | `select` | — | newest `workflow_snapshots` row | the workflow has ≥1 published snapshot |
  | `prompt` | 提示词 | `textarea` | — | Start node's 初始提示词; blank means "use the workflow's own prompt" | always |
  | `context_refs` | 补充上下文引用 | `multi_select` | — | none (empty = add nothing) | the issue has a project or a parent |

  `version` offers snapshot **ids** (a run is created from an id, and the id keeps pointing at the same
  frozen document); the version number rides in the label as `v3 · <snapshot name>`. An unpublished
  workflow has nothing to offer and the field is **dropped** rather than injected empty — the contract
  has no way to express a select with no choices. `context_refs` is **additive**: the issue's own
  persisted references are already on every run it starts, so its options are the references the issue
  can name for itself (`project:<id>`, `parent_issue:<id>`) and it opens on nothing selected.
  A workflow that already declares one of these keys keeps its own label/type/requiredness and only
  gains a default when that default validates against its control. Unknown or foreign issue ⇒ 404.

  That table is the platform's **catalogue**, not the form: the workflow's author declares which of
  those fields their workflow's form asks for, and which of them it insists on (§38.37d). The
  declaration rides in the graph envelope as `launchFields`, a sibling of `globalVariables`, and is
  read **per key** — `[{"key":"version","enabled":false},{"key":"prompt","required":true}]` turns off
  the version choice and makes the prompt mandatory, and every key it does not mention keeps the
  catalogue's own answer. That is what keeps a workflow declaring nothing rendering exactly the table
  above, and a field added to the catalogue later appears for every workflow without re-saving one.
  `enabled: false` removes the field from the descriptor (`repository` and `branch` included), after
  which a value for that key is an **unknown key** on both `assist` and `confirm` — they re-resolve
  the same declaration — and AI Assist can no longer suggest it. `required` overrides the catalogue's
  answer in both directions and is enforced server-side by `confirm` (400 `required_field_missing`).
  Two rules outrank the declaration: a field with **nothing to offer** is dropped whatever the author
  asked for (`version` with no published snapshot, `context_refs` for an issue that names no
  reference), and a key the author declared as a **Start variable of their own** is theirs — the
  declaration is inert for that key, control and requiredness alike. Edited in the workflow editor's
  `@ 表单字段` dialog, which writes all five keys with both answers spelled out; it takes effect on the
  next descriptor read, because the projection reads the live graph rather than a published snapshot.
- The graph's `globalVariables` are projected **after** the author's Start variables, one optional field
  each, keyed and labelled by the variable name, defaulted from its declared `value`. `number`/`integer`
  → `number`, `boolean` → `boolean`, `string`/`secret` → `text`, everything else (arrays, objects, files)
  → `textarea` holding JSON. A name without a `.` is not a global and is dropped.
- The three routes must agree: `assist` and `confirm` re-resolve the descriptor with the **same** issue
  context, so a client that fetches with `?issueId=` must confirm against that same issue (a client
  rendering the un-injected form gets 400 `required_field_missing` on confirm). `prompt`, `repository`,
  `branch`, `version` and `context_refs` are **reserved keys** — an executor that validates run input
  against Start variables must map them explicitly. `context_refs` is reserved in a second sense: the
  surface reads its value back out (a list of `refType:refId` strings) and turns it into the run's
  `contextRefs`, in addition to whatever AI Assist applied.
- `values` is a plain `{fieldKey: value}` map, re-validated server-side against the **current**
  descriptor: unknown key / wrong type / value outside `options` → 400 `invalid_field_value`; missing
  required → 400 `required_field_missing`.
- Confirm claims the interaction with a compare-and-set on `run_id IS NULL`: a second confirm (different
  key) → 409 `interaction_already_confirmed`; the same key + same body replays the stored response.
- Confirm on a non-`form` interaction → 409 `interaction_not_confirmable`.
- **Assist is stateless and takes a `targetId`, not an interaction**: the form is a *draft* until the
  user confirms it, so assist must work before any interaction exists and must write nothing. An
  unknown/non-workflow target → 404 `target_not_found`.
- Capability states: `503 form_descriptor_unavailable` / `503 assist_unavailable` (port not wired);
  `404 form_descriptor_not_found` (unknown `formRef`); `500 invalid_form_descriptor` (provider bug).
- The confirmed values land in `issue_interactions.input`; the effective execution snapshot in
  `issue_runs.input`; a workflow run's message is a `system` **activity**, never a `workflow` comment.

| DELETE 🔑 | `/spaces/{sid}/plugins` | `identifier`*, 🔢`version` | `{resource: SpacePlugin}` |

### Access model (Project Workspace Sharing, Step 3)

Projects are **workspace-shared**: `CanAccessProject(user, P) = P.space_id = W AND user is an active
member of W`. Concretely:

- **Space-scoped project** (`space_id` set): `GET /projects/{pid}`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`, the runtime
  workspace `GET /workspaces/{wid}`, and `GET /projects/{pid}/workspaces` are reachable by **any active
  workspace member**, regardless of creator. Deleting requires the **project creator OR a workspace
  owner/admin** (unified rule `CanDeleteWorkspaceResource`): an ordinary member who can read but not
  delete gets **403 `space_role_required`**; a non-member never reaches the gate (`project()` hides the
  resource with 404, no existence leak).
- **Legacy unscoped project** (`space_id` NULL): keeps **owner-only** access end to end (detail, runtime
  workspaces, delete); no auto-backfill, no scope widening.
- **Lists**: the space-scoped list `GET /spaces/{sid}/projects` returns every active project in the
  workspace (membership-gated); the **tenant-level `GET /projects` stays owner-filtered** (the space view
  is the sharing surface; the frontend does not use the tenant-level list).
- **Runtime Workspaces inherit the parent Project's access**: `GET /workspaces/{wid}` resolves the parent
  project's `space_id` and applies the workspace-membership rule; unscoped parents stay owner-only. No
  per-runtime member table.
- **No per-project membership**: `project_members` is **NOT used**; `owner_user_id` continues to record
  the creator.
- **Frontend delete button (Step 3A)**: the detail page's delete button gate now mirrors the backend rule
  (`creator OR workspace owner/admin`), so a member who created a project sees their own delete button;
  the backend delete authorization is unchanged.

## Internal / control API (`/internal/v1`)

Service-only (no user token except where noted). `epoch` = controller fencing. See
[../../core-contract.md](../../core-contract.md) + [../../execution-contract.md](../../execution-contract.md).

| Action | Path | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| access | `/internal/v1/access` | +user token; `tenantId, workspaceId, action, epoch` |
| admit | `/internal/v1/admissions` | +user token; `tenantId, workspaceId, action, ticketId, kind, epoch` |
| lease_acquire / renew / release | `/internal/v1/controller-lease/*` | controller leadership |
| claim | `/internal/v1/operations/claim` | poll next operation |
| snapshot | `/internal/v1/operations/{oid}/snapshot` | restricted aggregate |
| plan | `/internal/v1/operations/{oid}/effects` | persist external-effect plan |
| effect_result | `/internal/v1/operations/{oid}/effects/{eid}/result` | report substrate outcome |
| advance / defer | `/internal/v1/operations/{oid}/advance` `/defer` | step machine |
| node_register / status / idle | `/internal/v1/nodes/*` | node lifecycle |
| node_finish | `/internal/v1/nodes/tickets/{ticket}/finish` | execution ticket |

## Field validation (`validField`)

| Field(s) | Accepted JSON type |
| --- | --- |
| default (incl. `title`, `status`, `name`, `body`, `key`, …) | string |
| `version`, `epoch`, `position`, `retrySeconds`, … | integer (json.Number, Int64) |
| `ids` | array of strings |
| `filter`, `properties`, `input` | object |
| `idle`, `initialized` | bool |

Unknown body key → 400 `unknown_field`; wrong type → 400 `invalid_field_type`; `null` body on
non-GET → 400 `invalid_json` (send `{}` for an empty body, e.g. label detach).
