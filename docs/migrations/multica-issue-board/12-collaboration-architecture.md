## 0. Current status (post-Wave 3A)

> Added after Wave 3A landed; kept here so readers reconcile the frozen design with what actually
> happened. The sections below are the **frozen rev. 2 design** — see §36 for what diverged.

- **Wave 3A** (Step 2 — issue-owned foundation) is **IMPLEMENTED / REVIEWED** (migration `0007`).
- **Wave 3B — Collaboration Integration Shell** (Steps 3–4: integration ports + in-memory dev fixtures)
  is **PLANNED**.
- **Wave 3C — Issue Detail & Collaboration UI** (Steps 5–9: projections + UI) is **PLANNED**.
- **Real Agent/Team/Workflow integration is BLOCKED ON EXTERNAL DESIGN.** Issues does not define their
  internal design — Agent/Team/Workflow internal design = **UNKNOWN** — it only constrains the
  consuming-side contract (§6.2).
- **REVISION: the `0008` `sim_*` relational catalog is SUPERSEDED.** §9/§24 originally sketched a
  `0008_sim_collaboration_catalog.sql` with `sim_agents`/`sim_teams`/`sim_team_members` tables. That is
  no longer the plan: dev/demo fixtures are **in-memory adapters** implementing the same ports
  (`ExecutionDispatcher`, fake resolvers, …), not a new simulator relational schema. Issue core never
  gains `sim_*` tables; the run/assignee/timeline contract stays unchanged.

# Part I — Context & principles

## 1. Goal

Long-term: bring Multica's Issue **collaboration + execution** model into Ora Cloud so an issue is a
place where multiple actors collaborate and where work is **executed and observable** — with the
**Issues module owning only issue-domain state** and depending on everything else through ports.

This wave's target capabilities (planned, not built):

1. **Issue-owned domain** — Issue, IssueStatus, IssueComment, IssueRun, IssueActivity/Timeline
   projection, IssueContextRef, issue-level trigger provenance, and (later) IssueDependency /
   IssueAcceptanceCriteria / IssueReaction.
2. **Actor model** — `ActorRef` (user/agent/team/system) for authors/assignees/activity actors, and
   `CollaborationTargetRef` (user/agent/team/**workflow**) for mentions/conversation/invocation.
3. **Polymorphic issue assignee** — user/agent/team, with **Assign ≠ Execute**.
4. **Issue → multiple Runs** — `issue_runs` issue-owned; executor referenced, not embedded.
5. **Execution process viewing** — run state + progress surfaced on Issue Detail.
6. **Conversation continuation** — a stable `ConversationTarget` keeps follow-ups flowing to the
   current executor without re-@mentioning.
7. **Explicit `@targets`** — mentions are resolved targets, not regex-sole triggers.
8. **Workflow invocation** — workflow as a *capability* (not an actor) with schema-driven input
   assistance and user confirmation.
9. **Unified Timeline** — one ordered, stable stream of comments + activities; a **projection**,
   not an event source.
10. **Simulator adapters now** — every external port has an Unavailable/Simulator/Real triple; the
    fake executor holds the execution side without an LLM.

Explicitly out of this wave: real LLM/runtime, Autopilot, production WebSocket, multi-agent
orchestration, any `internal/core` refactor, DB-framework swap, and **permanent ownership of
agent/team/workflow/notification/PR/logs modules** (§32).

Measured endpoint of this wave: **an approved architecture + first coding batch scoped**, not code.

## 2. Current Cloud state

As of migration `0006`:

- **Identity/tenancy** (`0001_core.sql`): `tenants`, `users`, `user_identities`,
  `tenant_memberships(role admin/member)`. `identity()` auto-provisions users; `membership()` gates.
- **Issue board** (`0005`/`0006`): `issues.assignee_user_id uuid REFERENCES users(id)` (bare user FK),
  `parent_issue_id` self-ref `ON DELETE SET NULL`, `status`/`priority` text checks, `position`,
  per-tenant `number`, untyped `properties`; `issue_comments.author_user_id` composite-FK to
  `tenant_memberships`, **no `parent_id`**, **no agent author columns**; `issue_statuses`, `labels`,
  `issue_subscribers`, `issue_views`.
- **Execution primitives that stay distinct**: `operations` (infra/node lifecycle),
  `execution_tickets` (effect/ticket scoping), and this wave's new **`issue_runs`** (AI work
  lifecycle). They never share columns or a state machine.
- **Store invariants**: single `core.Store.Public` → `transact` under global advisory lock
  `pg_advisory_xact_lock(67420911)` → raw SQL; `core.Object`/`Fault`; `version(o,v)` 428/409;
  `Idempotency-Key` on POST/DELETE; soft delete via `deleted_at`.
- **Simulator** (`internal/simulator`): no DB handle; polls internal HTTP claim
  (`/internal/v1/operations/claim`), advances state externally — the model for every fake adapter.
- **No** agent/team/workflow/run/timeline/mention/notification/realtime concept exists.

## 3. Relevant Multica behavior

Synthesized from four source audits. Only what drives Cloud's design is kept.

- **Actors**: Agent = workspace-scoped, no `version`, `status` = runtime state, enable/disable =
  `archived_at` soft delete. Squad = roster + **`leader_id NOT NULL REFERENCES agent`**; only the
  leader is executable; human members read-only; no-executable-agent → fail closed.
- **Run unit = `agent_task_queue`**: one row = one run; `agent_id` FK → agent (executor is *always*
  an agent — squad via `squad_id`+`is_leader_task`); trigger = free pair `trigger_evidence_kind` +
  `trigger_evidence_ref_id` (no FK); status transitions via **SQL `WHERE` guards**; **no
  `deleted_at`**; retry/chain via `attempt`, `parent_task_id`, `retry_of_task_id`, etc.
- **Polymorphic assignee at issue level**: `assignee_type ∈ {member,agent,squad}` + `assignee_id`
  (no FK); `validateAssigneePair`; assign/status triggers a run.
- **Timeline = two tables merged at read**: `activity_log` (pre-aggregated append-only events,
  `action` free-string + `details` jsonb + `actor_type/actor_id`) + `comment` (mutable content).
  Merge sorted `(created_at, id)`; per-list hardcap 2000, truncate-oldest-not-newest,
  thread-completion, `X-Timeline-Truncated`.
- **Mentions not stored** — parsed from markdown `mention://type/id`; explicit `@agent/@squad`
  enqueue a run and return per-target `CommentTriggerOutcome{queued/coalesced/deferred/blocked}`.
- **Agent's reply = a `comment` row** with `author_type='agent'` (not a chat row). Continuation =
  routing, not storage.
- **Field semantics**: `last_activity_at` monotonic `GREATEST`; `stage` (sub-issue barrier groups,
  orthogonal to status); `origin_*` provenance; `properties` typed+catalogued vs `metadata`
  schema-less; reactions; dormant `context_refs`/`acceptance_criteria`/`dependencies`.

## 4. Gap

Multica capability vs Cloud state, classified (preserved backlog):

**Already migrated:** core board, status catalog, comments (human-only), labels, subscribers, number,
untyped `properties`, search, batch, views, groups.

**Partially migrated:** assignee (human-only single FK → must become polymorphic); comments
(human-only, no threads/mentions/reactions/agent authors).

**Next (this wave's foundation):** issue-owned domain (§6) + integration ports (§6.2) + Issue Detail
(§13) + polymorphic assignee + `issue_runs` + timeline + explicit `@targets` + conversation target +
workflow invocation contract + context refs + simulator adapters.

**Later (needs this foundation):** Autopilot triggers, squad-leader fan-out, rich reply authorization,
usage accounting, real runtime/execution module.

**Requires foundation not yet present:** notifications/inbox, realtime, full-text/typed query engine,
files.

**Integration-dependent (external services):** PR linking + auto-close, chat origins (slack/lark/…),
Git providers.

**Deferred:** real LLM, real agent runtime, complex orchestration, production WebSocket, core refactor,
DB-framework swap (§32).

## 5. Design principles

1. **Additive first** — new migrations, new core files, new routes; no `internal/core` refactor, no
   DB-framework replacement, no edit of applied migrations `0001–0006`.
2. **Follow Cloud's architecture** — route allowlist → `core.Store.Public` → raw SQL in one
   advisory-locked transaction; `core.Object`/`Fault`; `validField`; OpenAPI generator.
3. **Preserve Cloud's persistence invariants** — tenant scope, `version`, `Idempotency-Key`,
   `deleted_at` soft delete.
4. **Own the domain, not the world** — Issues persists only refs to external actors/executors; every
   external capability is reached through a stable **port** with an Unavailable/Simulator/Real
   state. An Agent is not a user; a Team is not a user; a **Workflow is not an actor**.
5. **IssueRun is not an Operation** — `issue_runs` has its own table, state machine, lifecycle; it
   never touches `operations`/`execution_tickets`.
6. **Multica Workspace ≠ Cloud Workspace** — Cloud `workspace` stays a dev-environment worktree;
   Issue is a tenant-level object with an *optional* `project_ref`; real execution context is carried
   by the run, not by the issue being workspace-bound.
7. **Assign ≠ Execute** — changing responsibility never silently starts work; execution is an
   explicit, observable act (§10).
8. **Simulator adapters now, real modules later** — fake adapters implement the same port contracts
   as future real modules, so swapping the sender changes nothing downstream (§22).
9. **Re-implement, don't copy** — record deliberate divergences here and in `08-differences.md`.

# Part II — Cross-module architecture

## 6. Cross-Module Boundaries & Integration Ports

### 6.1 Ownership split

**Issues module owns** (issue-domain state and behavior):

- Issue, IssueStatus (catalog), IssueComment, IssueRun
- IssueActivity / Timeline projection
- IssueContextRef (issue-scoped references, incl. sub-issue context inheritance)
- Issue Dependency, Issue Acceptance Criteria, Issue Reaction (deferred but issue-domain)
- Issue-related collaboration references (assignee refs, `@target` provenance)
- Issue-level invocation / trigger provenance (who/what triggered a run, recorded as evidence)

**Issues module does NOT own** — even when the module does not exist yet:

- Agent domain, Team domain, Workflow domain
- Agent runtime, Node / Sandbox, Model provider
- Notification delivery, WebSocket connection
- PR provider, Git provider
- Execution-logs storage implementation

These are reached only through ports. Issues never takes *de facto* ownership of them by default.

### 6.2 Integration ports (conceptual contracts)

Ports are **concepts this wave — no Go interfaces are required yet**, but the responsibility and
minimal contract are frozen so real modules can implement them later and fake adapters can stand in
now. Interfaces will be defined at the consuming boundary (AGENTS.md: "accept interfaces at the
consuming boundary") during implementation. A future package layout is sketched in §35.

---

**ActorResolver**

- Issues needs (per ref): existence, active?, display name, can execute?.
- Returns: `ActorRef → ActorSummary{displayName, active, executable?}`.
- Issues must NOT know: agent model, runtime, provider, MCP, skills, API keys, internal team
  orchestration.
- States:
  - `Unavailable` → capability_unavailable (resolve returns unavailable)
  - `Simulator` → FakeActorResolver over a dev catalog (§9)
  - `Real` → Agent/Team modules' resolver

**ExecutionDispatcher**

- Issues sends: `StartExecution / CancelExecution / ContinueExecution`.
- Minimal input: `{tenantId, issueId, issueRunId, executorRef, executionContextRef, triggerRef}`.
- Returns: `{accepted, externalExecutionId}`.
- Execution system later reports via stable events/callbacks: `started, progress, waiting, message,
  completed, failed, cancelled`.
- IssueRun stays issue-owned. Runtime/process/node/sandbox are not issue-domain.
- States:
  - `Unavailable` → `capability_unavailable`
  - `Simulator` → deterministic fake execution (§22)
  - `Real` → actual runtime implementation

**WorkflowResolver**

- Issues needs: `WorkflowSummary{id,name,description,inputSchema}`, `validateInputs`,
  `invoke(workflowRef, input, issueRef, runRef)`.
- Issues does NOT own workflow definitions or their execution logic.
- States: `Unavailable` → capability_unavailable; `Simulator` → FakeWorkflowResolver with canned
  schemas; `Real` → Workflow module.

**NotificationSink**

- Issues only produces: `{recipientRef, eventType, resourceRef, payload}`.
- Delivery (in-app, desktop, email, Slack, Lark…) is the notification module's.
- States: `Unavailable` → no-op sink (accepts and drops, logs); `Simulator` → records to a table/
  response for demo; `Real` → notification module.

**RealtimePublisher**

- Issues only emits stable domain events: `issue.updated`, `issue.timeline.appended`,
  `issue.run.updated`.
- Issues must NOT know WebSocket connection/session details.
- States: `Unavailable` → no-op publisher (HTTP refetch remains the transport); `Simulator` → emits
  to a local channel (used by demo polling); `Real` → event bus / WS gateway.

**ProjectContextResolver**

- Issues only fetches by ref: `project`, `workspace`, `repository`, `branch`, `execution context`
  summaries. No coupling to Project/Workspace internal schema.
- States: `Unavailable` → returns null refs (Issue Detail "Development" panel shows placeholders);
  `Simulator` → FakeProjectContextResolver with canned summaries; `Real` → Project/Workspace module.

**PullRequestResolver**

- Issues only gets/links: PR summary, URL, state, provider reference. No GitHub SDK logic in Issues.
- States: `Unavailable` → no PR panel; `Simulator` → fake PR summaries; `Real` → PR integration module.

**ExecutionLogProvider**

- Issues needs: `{executionId → logAvailability, logLink/ref, summary}`. Full
  stdout/stderr/PTY/tool logs are owned by the execution module.
- States: `Unavailable` → "logs unavailable"; `Simulator` → fake log refs + short summaries;
  `Real` → execution/logs module.

### 6.3 External capability states (one uniform model)

Every external module is described by a capability state; **no `if runtimeExists…`** inside issue
business code:

```
Unavailable  →  contract exists, capability returns capability_unavailable (HTTP 503-style or a
                typed fault) — UI shows an explicit "unavailable" state.
Simulator    →  deterministic fake adapter implements the same port (fake actors/team/workflow/
                executor/project/PR/logs) for demo and tests.
Real         →  actual module implements the same port; Issues core, IssueRun, Timeline, and UI
                contract do not change.
```

Adapters are swapped at the wiring boundary (router/simulator construction), never in issue-domain
code.

## 7. External capability states

See §6.3 for the model and per-port tables. The rule is restated here as an architectural invariant:

> Issue core code never branches on "which backend exists". It calls a port. The port's adapter is
> chosen at wiring time (Unavailable / Simulator / Real). Everything issue-owned keeps a single code
> path.

## 8. Actor model: ActorRef vs CollaborationTargetRef

Two distinct reference types, **not** one:

```
ActorRef                    CollaborationTargetRef
- user                      - user
- agent                     - agent
- team                      - team
- system                    - workflow     ← a capability, NOT an actor
```

**ActorRef** — who authored / who is assigned / who is the activity actor:
- `author`, `assignee`, `issue_activities.actor`. `system` covers synthetic/system events.

**CollaborationTargetRef** — what a mention / conversation / invocation addresses:
- `@target`, conversation target, invocation target.
- **Workflow is not an ActorRef.** A workflow is an invocable capability with an input schema, not a
  personified collaborator; forcing it into the actor model would leak execution semantics into
  authorship/assignment. (Multica has no workflow-actor either — its actor types are
  member/agent/system; Cloud adds `team` to the actor side and workflow only to the target side.)

Storage: both are `type` + `id` pairs, validated through the relevant resolver. No FK (spans modules).

## 9. Agent / Team references — ownership boundary & temporary dev catalog

**Rev. 1 planned `agents` / `teams` / `team_members` as issue-owned tables. Rev. 2 does not.** The
issue schema stores **references only**:

```
issues.assignee_type/assignee_id     (ActorRef → user|agent|team)
issue_runs.executor_ref              (see §11)
comments.author_type/author_id       (ActorRef → user|agent|system; team authors rare, allowed)
comments.targets[].{type,id}         (CollaborationTargetRef)
```

Validation goes through `ActorResolver`/`CollaborationTargetResolver` — never direct `SELECT agents…`
in issue core.

**Temporary dev catalog** (for demo/test until real Agent/Team modules exist):

> **SUPERSEDED (post-Wave 3A).** The `sim_agents`/`sim_teams`/`sim_team_members` relational catalog and
> its `0008_sim_collaboration_catalog.sql` migration are **dropped from the plan** (see §0). Replacement:
> **in-memory dev fixtures** implementing the same ports — no new simulator relational schema, no `sim_*`
> tables in issue core.

- *(Superseded bullet, retained for history.)* Originally: a simulator-owned catalog `sim_agents`,
  `sim_teams`, `sim_team_members` in a migration `0008_sim_collaboration_catalog.sql`, read by
  `FakeActorResolver`/`FakeTeamResolver`; issue core never touches it.

**Replacement plan (recorded, not hypothetical):**

| Concern | Statement |
| --- | --- |
| Temporary ownership | `sim_*` catalog belongs to the simulator/dev adapter, not Issues. |
| Migration strategy | ~~Landed in its own migration `0008`~~ — **SUPERSEDED**: no `sim_*` migration; in-memory fixtures implement the same ports instead. |
| Replacement boundary | Real Agent/Team modules land; they own their tables; fake resolvers are swapped at wiring; no `sim_*` tables to drop. |
| What remains stable | Issue columns (`assignee_type/assignee_id`), `issue_runs.executor_ref`, Timeline, UI contract. |
| What is removed/reused | Fixture adapters replaced; port contracts reused verbatim by the real modules. |

## 10. Issue assignee & Assign ≠ Execute

**Today:** `issues.assignee_user_id uuid REFERENCES users(id)` (bare FK).

**Target (additive, backward compatible):**

```
assignee_type text NOT NULL DEFAULT 'user'  CHECK IN ('user','agent','team')
assignee_id   uuid                          (no FK; resolved by type via ActorResolver)
```

- Backfill `assignee_type='user', assignee_id=assignee_user_id`; keep `assignee_user_id` readable
  (mirror-written when type=user) for one or two releases, dropped later — not this wave.
- Validation: `user`→active user; `agent`→resolvable+active via ActorResolver; `team`→resolvable+
  executable leader. Cross-tenant/missing → typed 404, never a partial assignment.

**Assign ≠ Execute (formal semantics, replaces rev. 1's "deferred automatic run"):**

- `Assign Agent` only changes **responsibility**. It does **not** imply execution.
- Execution is triggered explicitly by: **manual run · `@agent`/`@team` · conversation continuation ·
  `@workflow` invocation · retry**.
- Future (explicitly two behaviors, designed but not this wave): `Assign` vs `Assign and Start` —
  a caller-chosen variant, never a silent default.

The `trigger_evidence` on a run records which of these caused it (assign can still be recorded as
*context*, but assigning alone enqueues nothing).

## 11. IssueRun model

`issue_runs` — issue-owned AI work-lifecycle unit (**not** `operations`, **not** `execution_tickets`).

**Executor — final decision: stable polymorphic `executor_ref`, not Multica's `agent_id`.**

Two candidates were compared:

| | A — Multica style (`agent_id`, `team_id` nullable, `workflow_invocation_id`) | B — **chosen**: `executor_type` + `executor_id` (one polymorphic pair) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Future module ownership | couples IssueRun columns to external modules' shapes | external refs only, no coupling |
| Workflow support | awkward (a third nullable column) | `executor_type ∈ {agent, team, workflow}` natively |
| External adapters | per-type columns leak into issue domain | one pair, resolved via resolver/dispatcher |
| DB referential integrity | FKs to tables we don't own | none (external domain); app-layer validation |
| Migration simplicity | more columns/alterations later | one pair now |
| UI contract stability | shape changes when types grow | stable `{type,id}` forever |

Multica's agent-only executor is a consequence of Multica having only agents today; Cloud does not
mechanically copy it.

**Forbidden in `issue_runs`** — execution-system internals (unless genuinely opaque external refs):
`runtime_id`, `sandbox_id`, `node_id`, `model_id`, `provider_id`, `pty_session_id`. Only opaque
external refs are allowed: `externalExecutionId` (from ExecutionDispatcher), `executionContextRef`,
`workflowInvocationRef`.

**Columns:**

| Column | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `tenant_id, id, version, created_at, updated_at, deleted_at` | Cloud conventions; see §28 for `deleted_at` semantics. |
| `issue_id uuid NOT NULL` | `REFERENCES issues ON DELETE CASCADE`. |
| `executor_type` / `executor_id` | `CHECK IN ('agent','team','workflow')`; no FK; resolved via ports. |
| `external_execution_id` / `execution_context_ref` / `workflow_invocation_ref` | Opaque external refs. |
| `trigger_evidence_kind` / `trigger_evidence_ref_id` | Free pair, no FK (assign/manual/mention/continuation/workflow/retry). |
| `status` | enum per §12, `CHECK` + `WHERE`-guarded. |
| `parent_run_id`, `retry_of_run_id`, `rerun_of_run_id`, `delegated_from_run_id`, `attempt`/`max_attempts` | run chains + retries. |
| `input jsonb`, `result jsonb`, `error text`, `failure_reason text`, `trigger_summary text` | payload + outcome. |
| `queued_at`, `dispatched_at`, `started_at`, `completed_at`, `fire_at`, `lease_expires_at` | lifecycle. |

**Divergences vs Multica (recorded):** executor polymorphic (B); `deleted_at` present but
`terminal status ≠ deleted` (§28); no `waiting_local_directory` state (§12); run rows kept forever
as history.

## 12. Run state machine

States: `queued, dispatched, running, completed, failed, cancelled, deferred`.
(`waiting_local_directory` — a Multica artifact with no Cloud equivalent — is **omitted**.)

- Non-terminal: `queued, dispatched, running, deferred`. Terminal: `completed, failed, cancelled`.
- Transitions are **SQL `WHERE status=…` guards**, not a central validator:

```
queued     → dispatched  (claim:   WHERE status='queued')
dispatched → running     (start:   WHERE status='dispatched')
running    → completed   (complete:WHERE status='running')
running    → failed      (fail:    WHERE status='running')
queued/dispatched → cancelled (WHERE status IN ('queued','dispatched'))
deferred   → queued      (promote: WHERE status='deferred' AND fire_at <= now())
```

- `deferred` = future `fire_at` (scheduled). Pending dedup: at most one `queued|dispatched` per
  `(issue_id, executor_ref)`.
- Execution-state feedback (`started/progress/message/completed/…`) enters via the
  **ExecutionDispatcher** port's event/callback contract and is projected into the run + Timeline;
  Issue core never polls runtime internals.

# Part IV — Collaboration surface

## 13. Issue Detail / Collaboration Surface

**Issue Detail is the core product surface of Issue Collaboration** — the page a user lands on when
clicking an issue from the board. It is a first-class target of the API projections and the demo, not
a demo sidebar.

Target layout (v1 UI target):

```

```

**Left — Activity (product name) / Timeline (internal model):** ordered stream of human comment,
agent message, team response, workflow invocation, run started/progress/completed/failed,
assignment changed, status changed, PR linked, child issue created, system activity (§14).

**Right — Properties:** Status, Priority, Assignee, Project, Parent Issue, Created At, Updated At,
Last Activity (all issue-owned today except Project, which is a `project_ref` via
ProjectContextResolver).

**Right — Development (future):** Repository, Workspace, Branch, Pull Requests, Latest Commit — all
via ProjectContextResolver / PullRequestResolver; show explicit "unavailable" when the capability is
Unavailable (§6.2).

**Right — Execution:** Current Executor, Current Run, Run Count, Execution Context, Execution Logs
via ExecutionLogProvider (§15). `issue_runs` is issue-owned; logs are not.

**Bottom input:** message + explicit `@target` + current `ConversationTarget` indicator
("Continue with: BackendAgent") + Workflow → "Configure Workflow" input mode (§17, §18).

## 14. Timeline model (projection + ordering — decided)

**Two-table read-merge, as v1** (`issue_activities` pre-aggregated append-only events + `issue_comments`
mutable content) — with ordering **decided, not open**:

- **Per-issue `seq` shared by both tables.** Add `seq bigint` to `issue_comments` **and**
  `issue_activities`, both `UNIQUE(issue_id, seq)`. A single per-issue counter allocates the next
  value inside the advisory-locked transaction (`COALESCE(MAX(seq),0)+1` — the same race-free pattern
  as issue `number`).
- **Timeline ordering = `ORDER BY seq`.** `created_at` is display-only. Random UUIDs do **not**
  participate in ordering. No UUID-v2 migration, no tenant-global sequence.
- Comment list ordering becomes `seq` too (identical to creation order under the lock — a pure
  improvement over today's `created_at, id`).
- Hardcap per list (e.g. 2000 + 2000), probe at cap+1, **truncate-oldest-not-newest**,
  thread-completion (no orphan replies), `X-Timeline-Truncated` marker.

**Projection, not event source:**

- `Issue`, `Comment`, `IssueRun` … remain **authoritative state**.
- `issue_activities` is an **append-only projection / audit surface**; no business state is ever
  rebuilt by replaying the timeline.
- Recovery for a failed activity write (projection lag) is **Deferred** (§32): the semantic is that
  a missed activity may never be retroactively inserted into the user-visible `seq` order; a
  reconciler (if added later) must not reorder existing `seq` values.

## 15. Timeline vs Execution Logs (strictly separate)

```
Timeline        = human-readable issue activity   (issue-owned projection)
Execution Logs  = low-level execution/debug data  (execution module owns storage)
```

- Timeline may show: "Started execution", "Reading repository", "Tests failed", "Agent responded",
  "Run completed" — coarse, human-readable entries.
- Execution Logs may contain: PTY, stdout, stderr, tool calls, command logs, runtime diagnostics —
  low-level, owned by the execution module.
- Issue Detail's Execution panel offers **"View execution logs"** which goes through
  **ExecutionLogProvider** (`{executionId → logAvailability, logLink/ref, summary}`). Issues never
  stores or renders full logs.

## 16. Mention model (explicit resolved targets)

Rev. 1 (and Multica) used **markdown-regex-as-protocol**. Rev. 2 makes the contract **explicit
resolved targets**:

```json
POST /issues/:iid/comments
{
  "body": "@SecurityAgent review this",
  "targets": [
    { "type": "agent",   "id": "..." },
    { "type": "workflow","id": "..." }
  ]
}
```

- `body` is for display; **`targets` carry the business semantics**.
- The server **validates each target** via CollaborationTargetResolver (exists, active,
  invocable-for-this-actor); invalid/unresolvable targets → per-target `blocked` outcome.
- The markdown `mention://type/id` link remains only a **UI serialization compatibility** format —
  rendering, not trigger authority.
- Rationale for explicit-over-parse: regex-sole triggers make invocation depend on string matching
  (fragile, spoofable in body text, untyped); resolved targets give a typed, validated, replayable
  contract and align with `CollaborationTargetRef` (§8) and trigger provenance (§16 end).
- Each comment's response returns `triggerOutcomes: [{targetType, targetId, status ∈
  queued/coalesced/deferred/blocked, reasonCode}]` so the UI can say "posted, 1 of 2 targets
  triggered".

## 17. Conversation continuation & ConversationTarget

- **Agent/team replies are `comment` rows** (`author_type='agent'`, `author_agent_id=…`), never chat
  rows.
- **ConversationTarget** — a per-issue-detail, per-actor current target
  `{type ∈ agent|team|workflow, id, displayName}`:
  - Plain follow-up ("继续采用方案 B。") **continues the current target** without re-@mentioning.
  - An explicit `@X` **introduces/switches** the participant (or starts a parallel thread).
  - A workflow target switches the input area to **"Configure Workflow"** mode (§18) instead of chat.
- Server-side: continuation routes a no-`targets` reply to the current target (enqueue/merge via
  `(issue_id, executor_ref)` pending dedup), with reply-authorization scoped to the triggering
  thread. `trigger_evidence` records `conversation_continuation`.

## 18. Workflow Invocation Model

**Workflow = specialized executable capability, not an ordinary agent, not an actor.**

- Characteristics: focused function; typed input schema; **cannot be blindly executed on `@`** —
  schema must be resolved first, inputs auto-filled from Issue context, required-but-missing inputs
  requested, and the final input shown/confirmed before an invocation/run is produced.
- **WorkflowSummary** (via WorkflowResolver): `{id, name, description, inputSchema}`.
- **Invocation** (issue-adjacent, recorded on the run): `{workflowRef, issueRef, runRef, input,
  status}`; `workflow_invocation_ref` is an opaque external ref on `issue_runs`.
- UI flow on `@SecurityReviewWorkflow`:

```
Review scope            [ Current issue changes ]   ← autofill from Issue context
Review depth            [ Standard ]
Include dependencies    [ yes ]
Additional instructions [ ... ]

                          [ Run Workflow ]
```

- Issue core does not own workflow definitions/execution; it calls `WorkflowResolver.invoke` and
  projects the result back onto the run + Timeline.

## 19. Workflow Input Assistance

Three layers (this wave: **contract only**, no intelligent assistance):

1. **Context autofill** — prefill from issue context: `issue, project, workspace, PR, current run,
   acceptance criteria, selected messages` (via `issue_context_refs`, §20, and resolvers).
2. **Missing-input prompt** — if the schema requires `environment` but issue context has none, the UI
   explicitly asks the user to choose.
3. **Assisted suggestion (future)** — an agent may *suggest* scope/depth/files, but the user must
   always see and confirm the final input.

Design goal: user-visible, confirmable final input before any invocation/run is produced.

## 20. Sub-Issue Context Inheritance

Issue Detail supports **Create Sub-Issue** (`parent_issue_id = current issue`). Principle:
**reference context, don't duplicate it.**

- New table `issue_context_refs` (issue-owned): `tenant_id, issue_id, ref_type, ref_id, created_at`.
  `ref_type` covers `parent_issue`, `run`, `timeline_message`, `pull_request`, `project`,
  `workspace`, `acceptance_criteria`, and other external resources; `ref_id` is opaque (no FK),
  resolved through the appropriate port.
- A sub-issue starts with context refs (not copies) to: parent issue, selected run (if any), selected
  timeline message (if any), PR/project/workspace/acceptance criteria as applicable.
- Rev. 1 note: Multica's `context_refs` is a dormant JSONB column with no consumer; Cloud uses a real,
  queryable issue-owned table instead — a deliberate divergence, not a copy.
- v1 implementation = minimal schema (table + a few ref types), not the full assistance UX.

# Part V — Context & integration boundaries

## 21. Project / Workspace / PR execution context

Rev. 1 said "future work, not designed here"; **that is revised** — a minimal stable boundary is
defined now (while still not mapping Multica Workspace → Cloud Workspace).

**Option comparison:**

| | Option | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A | `issues.project_id` (single column) | Couples Issue to Project schema; doesn't cover workspace/branch/context. |
| B | `issue_context_refs` for project | Good for *references*, not enough as the issue's primary project display field. |
| C | `issue_runs.execution_context_ref` only | Right for *execution*, but Issue Detail needs a project display without a run. |
| D | **Issue optional `project_ref` + Run `execution_context_ref`** | **Chosen.** |

**Decision — Option D:**

- `issues.project_ref uuid` **nullable** — display ("belongs to project") via
  ProjectContextResolver; a tenant-level Issue is allowed to have no project. Resolved against Cloud's
  existing `projects` (dev-environment repositories) — semantically "which repository context", not a
  re-mapping of Multica Workspace.
- `issue_runs.execution_context_ref` — the concrete execution context (Project/Workspace/Repository/
  Branch) known to the execution module at run time; opaque to Issues, resolved via
  ProjectContextResolver.
- PR display/linking via PullRequestResolver (summaries/URL/state only) — §23.

## 22. Simulator boundary & fake adapter seam

The **Fake Executor implements the `ExecutionDispatcher` port**, it is not a bespoke runtime API:

```
Issue Core → ExecutionDispatcher → Simulator Adapter   (now)
Issue Core → ExecutionDispatcher → Real Runtime Adapter (future)
IssueRun / Timeline / API contract: unchanged across both.
```

- Simulator Adapter copies `internal/simulator`'s shape: **no DB handle**, polls the internal HTTP
  control API for a claimable run (`POST /internal/v1/issue-runs/claim`, service JWT,
  `role=node/controller`), then reports `started/progress/completed/failed` back through the port's
  callback path.
- Same for the other ports: `FakeActorResolver`, `FakeTeamResolver`, `FakeWorkflowResolver`,
  `FakeProjectContextResolver`, `FakePullRequestResolver`, `FakeExecutionLogProvider`, plus
  no-op NotificationSink / RealtimePublisher adapters — all stand-ins behind the identical contract.
- No `if runtimeExists…` anywhere in issue core (§6.3).

## 23. PR / Logs boundary

- **PullRequestResolver**: Issues may list/link PR summaries (title, URL, state, provider ref) on
  Issue Detail; GitHub/Git SDK logic lives in the PR module, never in Issues.
- **ExecutionLogProvider**: Issues surfaces log availability/links/summaries per run; raw
  stdout/stderr/PTY/tool logs live in the execution/logs module (§15).
- Both are `Unavailable → Simulator → Real` triple-state (§6.2); when Unavailable the Issue Detail
  panels render explicit "unavailable" placeholders instead of hiding the feature.

---

# Part VI — Implementation surface

## 24. Proposed database migrations

Two migrations this wave — the split itself encodes the ownership boundary:

- **`0007_issue_collaboration.sql`** (issue-owned, additive; edit nothing older):
  - `issues` ALTERs: `assignee_type`/`assignee_id` (+ backfill), `project_ref uuid` (nullable).
  - `issue_comments` ALTERs: `parent_id uuid REFERENCES issue_comments` (threading),
    `author_type`/`author_agent_id`/`author_team_id` (nullable; human authors keep
    `author_user_id`), `seq bigint` (`UNIQUE(issue_id, seq)`).
  - New tables: `issue_runs` (§11 columns + `seq` not needed), `issue_activities`
    (`tenant_id, issue_id, actor_type, actor_id, action, details jsonb, seq, created_at`),
    `issue_context_refs` (§20).
- ~~**`0008_sim_collaboration_catalog.sql`** (temporary, simulator-owned dev catalog): `sim_agents`,
  `sim_teams`, `sim_team_members`.~~ **SUPERSEDED** (see §0): no `sim_*` tables; in-memory dev fixtures
  implement the same ports.

No `operations`/`execution_tickets`/`users`/`tenant_memberships` semantic changes. Agents/teams are
**not** principals.

## 25. Proposed API changes

New public routes (tenant-scoped; `adding-features.md` 8-step sequence; recall the two OpenAPI traps:
insert resource branches before `Contains(path,"/issues")`, and add any non-string body field to
`validField`):

- **Assignee (existing issues):** `POST/PUT /issues` accept `assigneeType`/`assigneeId` (legacy
  `assigneeUserId` honored).
- **Runs:** `GET /issues/:iid/runs`, `GET /issues/:iid/runs/:rid`; `POST /issues/:iid/runs` (manual
  run, returns `{resource: IssueRun}`).
- **Timeline:** `GET /issues/:iid/timeline` (merged comments+activities, `ORDER BY seq`,
  `X-Timeline-Truncated`).
- **Comments:** existing routes gain `parentId` (threading) + `targets[]` (explicit resolved targets,
  §16); response returns `triggerOutcomes`. Agent authors allowed for fake-executor replies.
- **Context refs:** `GET/POST/DELETE /issues/:iid/context-refs` (minimal, §20).

**No** `/agents`, `/teams`, `/workflows` endpoints in the issue API — those belong to their future
modules. Issue Detail's agent/team/workflow data is rendered from `executor_ref`/`workflow_invocation`
resolved via ports, not from issue-owned CRUD.

OpenAPI: add `IssueRun`, `IssueActivity`, `TimelineEntry`, `ContextRef`, `CollaborationTarget`,
`TriggerOutcome`, `WorkflowInvocationRef` schemas; extend `Issue` (`assigneeType`/`assigneeId`/
`projectRef`), `Comment` (`parentId`, `targets`, author-actor fields, `seq`). Regenerate
`api/openapi.json`.

## 26. Backward compatibility

- Existing issue/comment endpoints keep their shapes; new fields/routes are additive.
- `assigneeUserId` keeps working; `author_user_id` keeps working for human authors.
- No applied migration edited; `0007`/`0008` purely additive; no existing route removed/re-tokenized.
- `operations`/`execution_tickets`/simulator unchanged.
- Contract test keeps `additionalProperties:false`; only new/extended resources add fields.

## 27. Tenant / security rules

- Every new table/query filters `tenant_id=$…`; cross-tenant resolution → 404, never a leak.
- `membership()` gates human actions. Agents/teams are **not** authenticated principals; agent/team
  authored content or runs can only be produced via (a) the public API as an authorized member, or
  (b) the internal control API as the simulator/execution adapter with a service JWT
  (`role=node/controller`).
- **Resolver validation is authoritative**: every `assignee_ref`/`executor_ref`/`target` is resolved
  through the port and fail-closed (typed 404/`blocked`), never trusted raw.
- Catalog mutation (`sim_*`) is admin-only (mirrors Multica's owner/admin guard).

## 28. Idempotency / version / soft-delete rules

- **Idempotency:** POST (agents/teams via their modules, runs, comments, context refs) require
  `Idempotency-Key`; run-enqueue dedup `(issue_id, executor_ref)` pending is a second layer.
- **Version:** `issue_runs` (mutable fields), `comments` carry `version` + `version(o,v)` 428/409 on
  PUT/PATCH. `issue_activities`, `issue_context_refs`, `team_members` are append/join-like — no
  version column.
- **Soft delete:**
  - `comments` soft-delete with tombstone for replies (thread completeness).
  - `issue_activities` append-only (no delete).
  - `agents`/`teams` (future modules) soft-delete; `sim_*` catalog rows soft-delete.
  - **`issue_runs.deleted_at` — terminal status ≠ deleted (final).** `completed`/`failed`/`cancelled`
    are **normal history records**. `deleted_at` exists only for explicit **hide/archive/admin
    cleanup** and there is **no delete-Run API this wave**. The rev. 1 phrase "terminal status =
    operational delete" is retracted.

## 29. Testing plan

- **Integration** (`integration/issue_collaboration_test.go`): polymorphic assignee (user/agent/team,
  invalid/foreign → 404); run lifecycle (enqueue→claim→complete via the fake executor; cancel;
  pending dedup); timeline merge + `seq` ordering + truncation; explicit `@targets` + `triggerOutcomes`;
  conversation continuation; context-refs CRUD.
- **Ports/adapter tests:** fake adapters implement the port contract; a harness drives
  claim/advance over the internal HTTP API (like simulator tests), asserting the no-DB-handle
  boundary and the Unavailable/Simulator/Real switching.
- **Contract:** regenerated `api/openapi.json` byte-verified.
- **Regression:** `go test ./internal/... ./cmd/...` + full integration suite green; migration list
  in `integration/cloud_test.go` bumped to include `0007` (+`0008` when the sim catalog lands).

## 30. Demo plan

Extend `cmd/demo-issue-board-web/` to the **Issue Detail surface** (§13):

- Config endpoint seeds a dev catalog (via the simulator adapter path) with a demo agent, demo team
  (leader agent), and a demo workflow.
- Issue Detail: left Activity/Timeline (comments + events, `@targets` input, "Continue with: …"),
  right Properties/Development/Execution panels; run enqueue + progress via the fake executor
  (polling); "View execution logs" → fake log summary; Create Sub-Issue with context refs.
- Everything stays on the real router (dual-JWT, idempotency, advisory-locked transactions).

## 31. Documentation updates

- This file (rev. 2) + `00-overview.md`/`06-implementation-log.md`/`08-differences.md` updates (when
  implemented).
- `08-differences.md` — append rev. 2 divergences: polymorphic `executor_ref` vs agent-only;
  `terminal ≠ deleted`; `seq` ordering; explicit targets vs regex mentions; temporary `sim_*` catalog;
  `context_refs` table vs Multica's dormant column.
- `docs/development/onboarding/progress.md` — Wave 3 stays **Planning**, scope updated (§34→§35 sync).
- `docs/development/agent/` — minimal "planned" pointer only; no fabricated API in "Where things are".

## 32. Deferred work

| Deferred | Why / when |
| --- | --- |
| Real LLM / real agent runtime / real execution module | Simulator adapters first; real modules implement the same ports later. |
| Real Agent / Team / Workflow domain tables & CRUD | Future modules; in-memory fake resolvers stand in (§9 — `sim_*` catalog superseded, §0). |
| Autopilot (schedule/manual/webhook triggers, rule versions) | Needs runs + trigger engine + runtime first. |
| Multi-agent orchestration / squad-leader fan-out | Single-executor runs first. |
| Production WebSocket / event bus | HTTP refetch + polling now. |
| Notifications/inbox, `@user` delivery | NotificationSink port exists; delivery deferred to the notification module. |
| Realtime delivery | RealtimePublisher port exists; no WS yet. |
| Activity-write failure recovery (projection reconciler) | Semantics fixed (§14); implementation deferred. |
| `Assign and Start` variant | Contract decided (§10); behavior not built. |
| `stage` (sub-issue barriers), reactions, dependencies, acceptance criteria | Orthogonal / dormant in Multica; post-foundation. |
| PR linking + `close_intent`, chat origins, files/attachments | External integration / no file storage. |
| `internal/core` refactor / DB-framework swap | Forbidden by principles. |

## 33. Risks / open questions

**Resolved this round** (no longer open):
1. Timeline ordering — per-issue `seq` shared by comments + activities, `ORDER BY seq` (§14).
2. Assign → Run — formal `Assign ≠ Execute` (§10).
3. `issue_runs.deleted_at` — terminal status ≠ deleted (§28).

**Remaining open:**
1. **Port wiring mechanism.** How adapters are selected at construction (config flags vs a small
   registry in the router/simulator wiring) — decide at Step 3/4 of implementation; must not leak
   into issue core.
2. **NotificationSink / RealtimePublisher consumers.** Contracts frozen but no consumer yet; when a
   notification/realtime module lands, verify the payload shapes (`recipientRef`, domain events)
   still fit.
3. **`project_ref` resolution details.** Cloud `projects` are dev-environment repositories with a
   lifecycle; pinning exact semantics of "belongs to project" (which states are valid for display,
   and how `execution_context_ref` maps to Project/Workspace/Repository) needs the Project module's
   input. Issue stays tenant-level with nullable `project_ref` meanwhile.
4. **Timeline truncation UX.** With two capped lists, where the truncated marker appears and how the
   UI loads earlier pages is unspecified (design in Step 5, not this wave).

## 34. Acceptance criteria

This wave (rev. 2) is complete when:

1. `12-collaboration-architecture.md` reflects: Issues-owns-the-domain + ports-only external access
   (§6), ActorRef vs CollaborationTargetRef (§8), temporary sim catalog with replacement plan (§9),
   Assign ≠ Execute (§10), polymorphic executor_ref (§11), Issue Detail surface (§13), decided `seq`
   ordering + projection (§14), explicit targets (§16), ConversationTarget (§17), Workflow model
   (§18–19), Sub-Issue context (§20), Option-D execution context (§21), port-first implementation
   order (§35).
2. `progress.md` marks Wave 3 **Planning** with the expanded scope, nothing listed as implemented.
3. `docs/development/agent/` carries only the minimal planned pointer, no fabricated API.
4. The first coding batch below is **scoped and agreed, not started**.
5. No code, migration, or applied-file change is made in this wave.

## 35. Recommended implementation order

Port-first (order respects "stabilize Issue-owned domain + ports before fake external modules"):

| Step | Focus |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | **Architecture / contracts frozen** (this doc; get the 4 open questions' owners). |
| 2 | **Issue-owned foundation** — target refs (`assignee_type/assignee_id`, comment author-actor,
      `project_ref`), `issue_runs`, `issue_activities` + `seq` ordering, `issue_context_refs`,
      migration `0007`, `PublicRequest`/`router`/`validField`/OpenAPI spine. |
| 3 | **Integration ports** — Go interfaces at the consuming boundary: `ActorResolver`,
      `ExecutionDispatcher`, `WorkflowResolver`, `ProjectContextResolver`, `NotificationSink`,
      `RealtimePublisher`, `ExecutionLogProvider` (+ `PullRequestResolver` interface-only).
      Wire points chosen here (see open Q1). |
| 4 | **Simulator adapters** — in-memory `FakeActorResolver`/`FakeWorkflowResolver`/
      `FakeProjectContextResolver`/fake executor + no-op sinks. **(`0008` sim catalog superseded — no
      `sim_*` tables.)** |
| 5 | **Issue Detail API projections** — timeline endpoint, runs endpoints, panels' projections
      (unavailable states honored). |
| 6 | **Conversation + explicit `@targets`** — target validation, `triggerOutcomes`,
      ConversationTarget routing. |
| 7 | **Workflow invocation** — schema resolve → autofill → missing-input → confirm → invoke → run. |
| 8 | **Sub-Issue context** — Create Sub-Issue + `issue_context_refs` population. |
| 9 | **Demo** — Issue Detail UI. |
| 10 | **Docs / tests / acceptance** — update migration + agent + onboarding docs, full gate
      (`task check`), acceptance review. |

In Cloud's monolith, Steps 2–3 may land in one change (ports are small and issue-owned code needs
them immediately); the ordering rule that must hold is: **issue-owned domain first, then ports, then
fake external adapters, then projections/UI** — never a real external module shipped by this team,
and never `agents`/`teams` CRUD pretending to be issue domain.

## 36. Wave 3A implementation notes (Step 2 landed)

The rev. 2 design is frozen. Step 2 (Issue-owned foundation) has now been implemented as **Wave 3A**
(`migration 0007` + the persistence/API-contract spine). This section records the concrete divergences
between the frozen doc and what landed, so later waves (ports → adapters → projections) work from the
code, not from a stale §.

1. **Comment author ActorRef is a single `{type,id}` pair.** §8/§14 and the rev.-1 draft referenced
   per-actor columns (`author_agent_id`/`author_team_id`). Wave 3A uses the uniform
   `author_type ∈ {user,agent,team,system}` + `author_id` shape instead — the same shape as
   `assignee_type/assignee_id` and `issue_activities.actor_type/actor_id`. `author_user_id` is kept and
   mirror-written for `user` authors (backward-compatible read path). No per-actor columns exist.
2. **`issue_runs.issue_id` has no `ON DELETE CASCADE`.** §11/§24 showed a cascade; the migration uses a
   plain `REFERENCES issues(id)`. Runs are retained history, and issues soft-delete anyway, so a hard
   cascade is both unreachable and destructive.
3. **Timeline `seq` is Option C** — a shared per-issue namespace allocated as
   `GREATEST(MAX(issue_comments.seq), MAX(issue_activities.seq)) + 1` inside the advisory-locked tx,
   rather than a `timeline_seq` column on `issues` (which would leak through `SELECT * FROM issues`
   into the `additionalProperties:false` OpenAPI contract). Comments list `ORDER BY seq, id`.
4. **Terminal run status ≠ deleted.** `completed`/`failed`/`cancelled` are history; there is no
   delete-run API; `deleted_at` on `issue_runs` is reserved for future hide/archive. The state guard
   stays in SQL `WHERE`, not a central validator.
5. **`project_ref` is shape-only.** A nullable `uuid` with no existence check (no
   `ProjectContextResolver` yet). Same for `assignee`/`executor`/`actor` refs of non-`user` type —
   opaque UUIDs, unresolved this wave.
6. **Scope held.** No `agents`/`teams`/`workflows`/`sim_*`/`runtime`/`notifications`/`websocket`/PR/logs
   schema or code landed. No `ActorResolver`/`ExecutionDispatcher`/port interfaces yet — those are
   Step 3. This wave is the issue-owned persistence + contract spine only, and it stops here.
